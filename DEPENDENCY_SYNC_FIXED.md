# ✅ DEPENDENCY SYNC ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED\!

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED**

### **❌ The Problem**
```
npm error code EUSAGE
npm error `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json are in sync
npm error Invalid: lock file's @types/react@18.3.11 does not satisfy @types/react@18.3.23
npm error Missing: @typescript-eslint/visitor-keys@8.34.0 from lock file
```

### **🔍 Root Cause**
The `package-lock.json` file was out of sync with `package.json`. Dependencies had been updated but the lock file wasn't regenerated, causing version mismatches.

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION APPLIED**

### **🔧 Complete Dependency Restoration**
1. **Removed outdated package-lock.json**: Cleared conflicting lock file
2. **Restored complete package.json**: Added all missing dependencies
3. **Regenerated package-lock.json**: Fresh install with `npm install`
4. **Tested build**: Verified all dependencies work correctly

### **📦 Dependencies Restored**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@react-three/drei": "^9.92.7",
    "@react-three/fiber": "^8.15.12",
    "framer-motion": "^10.16.16",
    "lucide-react": "^0.344.0",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
