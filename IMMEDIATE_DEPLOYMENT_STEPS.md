# üöÄ IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT STEPS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Manual Deployment Required

I cannot directly access your Netlify account to deploy, but I have prepared everything for you. Here are the exact steps to deploy your website:

---

## üìÅ **DEPLOYMENT PACKAGE READY**

Your complete website is built and ready in the `dist/` folder with:
- ‚úÖ **15 optimized files** ready for deployment
- ‚úÖ **Sitemap.xml** configured for https://kaleidoscopic-paletas-9f9af7.netlify.app
- ‚úÖ **Robots.txt** with correct domain
- ‚úÖ **All assets optimized** and compressed
- ‚úÖ **PWA features** enabled

2. Log in to your account
3. Find your site: `kaleidoscopic-paletas-9f9af7`
4. Click on the site to open it

### **Step 2: Deploy via Drag & Drop**
1. Click on the **"Deploys"** tab
2. You'll see a drag & drop area that says "Drag and drop your site output folder here"

## üìã **ALTERNATIVE: GITHUB AUTO-DEPLOY**

If you prefer automatic deployments:

### **Option A: Connect GitHub Repository**
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to **"Site settings"** > **"Build & deploy"**
2. Click **"Link to Git repository"**
3. Connect to: `Rakkontyagi/Mahi`
4. Set build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Node version**: `18`

### **Option B: Manual Git Deploy**
1. In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
2. Then drag the `dist/` folder to Netlify

## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING**

3. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
4. **Check Logs**: Look at Netlify deploy logs for errors

### **If Pages Don't Load:**
1. **Check _redirects**: File should be in dist/ folder
